Last year, I joined [Vercel](https://vercel.com) on a mission to grow the Next.js community. Today, I'm excited to announce **I've been** **promoted to Head of Developer Relations at Vercel**. I want to share how I got here, my plans for the future, and invite you to [join my team](https://vercel.com/careers).

## My Path Towards Developer Relations

I've always enjoyed the intersection of design, development, product management, marketing, and even sales. It stems from my entrepreneurial roots. However, this desire to work across many parts of the business often came across as indecisiveness in my career.

That was three years ago – around the same time I began using [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/). I didn't know what [Developer Relations](https://emilyfreeman.io/blog/developer-relations-more-than-the-art-of-talking-good) was at the time. However, I did know I wanted to create. I wanted to write, blog, tweet, record, post, and grow a community. I wanted to help others learn and progress in their careers. This realization led to me becoming a course creator and helping others learn to program.

After teaching over 100,000 developers from around the world, I joined the team at Vercel.

## The Future of Next.js and Vercel

Next.js is growing quickly with over a million installations per week.

One of the driving factors in the growth of Next.js and Vercel is the Developer Experience (DX). Our team sweats the details – the parts others might ignore. Design and DX are the foundation for everything we create. We're relentlessly [front-end focused](https://rauchg.com/2020/next-for-vercel#frontend-focus).

My plan for the future of Next.js and Vercel is to get folks excited and involved in the community. If you were one of the [80,000 registrants](https://vercel.com/virtual-event-starter-kit) of [Next.js Conf](https://nextjs.org/2020/conf) last year, wait until this year. I'm so incredibly excited. 2020 was a turning point for growth and we have ambitious goals for 2021.

Of course, none of this growth would be possible without the 1,500+ open-source contributors and the incredible work of the Next.js core team (who has recently doubled in size). I also want to thank our partners on the Google Chrome team and the React team at Facebook for helping improve Next.js.

## Join Me

I'm equally excited to announce we're growing our team with three roles:

- [Developer Advocate](https://vercel.com/careers) – Educate on the latest Next.js features, craft high-quality examples and demos, engage with our community, write documentation, and advocate for a faster web. This role will work closely with myself, Marketing, Product, and our CEO.
- [Field Engineer / Solutions Architect](https://vercel.com/careers) – Work with our sales team to provide solutions to customer's needs. You have a deep understanding of building large-scale applications, understanding technical requirements, and discussing tradeoffs. USA only (UTC −4 to -8). This was my previous role, highly recommended. Send me a message if you want to learn more.
- [Community Manager](https://vercel.com/careers) – Engage our community across platforms like GitHub, Twitter, Discord, StackOverflow, and more! Ensure our user's needs are met help gather customer feedback.

I’m the most energized and optimistic I’ve ever been in my 10 years as a developer. We're building a truly world-class team of folks at Vercel. If you want to join a high-growth startup, scale a community with millions of developers, and transform the way we build the web – join me!

Thank you to everyone who has supported me. To say I am humbled and grateful would be an understatement. Finally, I want to thank [Kevin](https://twitter.com/kevinvangundy) and [Hank](https://twitter.com/thehanktaylor) for helping me grow in my role at Vercel – and [Guillermo](https://twitter.com/rauchg) for steering the ship with impressive attention to detail and quality.
