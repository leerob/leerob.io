Developers want to be productive ‚Äì but are often slowed down by the complexity of their tools.

Tools that keep developers in the flow state have a magnetic force. An often unexplainable, invisible pull that attracts and retains them to certain products. This pull is developer experience (DX).

Products with a great developer experience are invaluable for a developer's workflow. I've used hundreds of products and devtools in my career, and the ones that keep me in the flow state and enable me to innovate stick around. I've been using Vercel for over four years now, and eventually [joined the team](/blog/hypergrowth) due to how the product enabled me to do my best work.

**It's an honor to share that I am now the VP of Developer Experience at Vercel** to continue to invest in the foundations of DX and community as a core part of the company strategy. This post outlines why we're expanding my role from leading our DevRel team to making Developer Experience part of the executive team.

## Investing in DX

DX isn't just important for customers ‚Äì it's also critical for product-led growth. By providing a [world-class developer experience](/blog/developer-experience-examples) for our products and tools, we've seen incredible growth.

- **The future is Edge first:** By enabling developers to `git push` to a global application in seconds, Vercel is now serving over 25B requests per week at the Edge and steadily growing. New Edge computing primitives like functions are taking this further, like [server-rendering SvelteKit](https://sveltekit-on-the-edge.vercel.app/) from an Edge Function.
- **Developers, developers, developers:** From ~40k developers in the Next.js Discord community to hyper-local groups of 40, we're helping educate and enable all developers in our community. Most recently, we had an [amazing meetup in Austin](https://twitter.com/leeerob/status/1531695305766445056).
- **Frameworks enable the developer:** We created Next.js to simplify the process of creating a server-rendered React application. By investing in the developer experience of the framework, and enabling developers to quickly build optimized React sites, we've seen Next.js grow to 2.7M downloads per week and even [more GitHub stars](https://github.com/vercel/next.js) than Node.js and Kubernetes with 88k.

## DX at Vercel

A great developer experience requires empathy for the day-to-day challenges of building software.

At Vercel, Developer Experience is a _superset_ of [Developer Relations](/blog/devrel-at-vercel) (which is focused on building community and advocating for the product) and Documentation.

Our organization has four DX pillars:

- **Education:** Enable developers of all experience levels to build on the web and master their craft.
- **Documentation:** Provide clear reference materials for using our products and unblock developers to complete their desired tasks.
- **Community:** Foster a frontend developer community that can build and learn together through meetups, conferences, and online communities.
- **Templates:** Make it easier to get started building with our tools while focusing on performance, accessibility, and design.

Engineering organizations can also have _internal_ developer experience (or [developer productivity](https://www.airbnb.com/careers/departments/engineering/dev_infra)) teams. They make tests more reliable, build shared tooling, improve build performance, and help teams get code shipped faster.

</Callout>

My team has four operating principles that help us [build a great developer experience](/blog/developer-experience-examples):

- **Increase exposure hours:** We can understand if developers are struggling with our product by [increasing our exposure hours](https://articles.uie.com/user_exposure_hours/#:~:text=Exposure%20hours.,the%20designs%20that%20team%20produces). We talk to developers, watch their videos or read their articles, and even sometimes join their live streams.
- **Learn by building:** We should use our product and be alpha testers for new features. Not only does this help us create educational content, it also surfaces product feedback and areas for improvement.
- **Empathy first:** We want to enable any developer to build quality software, and that requires understanding their day-to-day challenges. Having empathy for both beginners and experienced developers is critical.
- **Hell yeah or no:** If you're not feeling ‚Äú[hell yeah!](https://sive.rs/hyn)‚Äù then say no. This helps us focus on the most important work that is aligned with our values.

It's important to note we're not the only folks at Vercel thinking about DX. If we do our job right, _everyone_ will think about DX. We're ensuring the **end-to-end developer experience** of the platform.

## A New Vision for DevRel

DevRel as we know it is dead ‚Äì and that's exciting.

In the past, Developer Advocates might have traveled around the world speaking at conferences, spending months preparing and rehearsing for their talks. The last few years flipped DevRel on its head as travel wasn't an option anymore, and teams shifted to online conferences, live streams, and even more YouTube videos.

Now in 2022, we've started to return back to in-person conferences. But all this time away has changed the rules of the DevRel game. The power now lies with the content creators.

Hyper global and _hyper local_ is the future of advocacy. Conferences can still be incredibly powerful for connecting with a global community, but they have to be online-first. The quality of the online event should be as good as in-person. In my opinion, DevRel teams should be saying no to more conference talks. They should focus on the _highest impact_ talks that are hyper global, cut out the cruft in the middle, and double down on local meetups to engage and educate smaller communities.

## Thank You

When I reflect on the past few years, I'm thankful for the Vercel team and our wonderful community. I feel fortunate to work at a hypergrowth company building products so many developers love.

Possibly the most humbling and gratifying part of being a "developer educator" is helping folks land jobs ‚Äì and it's mind-blowing that two Vercel employees (üëã Garrett and Ismael) learned to code through content I've created and eventually became my coworkers.

So, thank you. Time to get started!
