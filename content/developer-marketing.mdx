Developer marketing is not traditional marketing.

The “enter your email to download the PDF” type. The “install in seconds” and then "drastically oversimplified promise" type.

Developers don’t trust this.

Not many companies get developer marketing right—and it’s because they’re trying to apply the enterprise marketing playbook to the wrong audience.

## Throw out the old playbook

Developers _love_ great marketing when properly targeted and given content that is interesting, deeply technical, and easy to consume. Most mistakes I’ve seen come from mixing up these two different segments:

- **Enterprise Marketing**
  - **Goal**: Grow pipeline and revenue
  - **Audience**: Directors, VPs, or C-suite
  - **Buyer Interests**: Increased efficiency, cost savings, innovation
  - **How**: Sales-served, sign a yearly contract for a discount
- **Developer Marketing**
  - **Goal**: Grow retained signups and community awareness
  - **Audience**: Individual developers
  - **Buyer Interests**: Transferable skills, affordable, great developer experience
  - **How**: Self-serve, start free then swipe a credit card

These buckets aren’t mutually exclusive, but general guidance. Even when targeted correctly, how do you present developers with content they want to click in to consume?

## What does great developer marketing look like?

I’m a developer who [works](/work) at the intersection of engineering, product, and marketing. Based on my experience, the best developer marketing:

1. **Teaches you how to build great products**
2. **Builds and retains trust**
3. **Uses incredibly precise language**

### How did they build that!?

When I see a great developer tool, my first thought is: **how did they build that?**

There’s a natural curiosity. I want to reverse engineer the product and learn new tools or skills I can apply to my work.

The best developer marketing is showing how to build great product experiences. Bonus points if you capture the “current thing” – maybe a new AI tool, or a popular style of app (TikTok clone).

Using our marketing categories from above:

- Enterprise marketing is a webinar showing how the team who adopts your product iterates faster and saves the company money.
- Developer marketing is a live stream where a developer builds the product together with the community, sharing the open-source code after.

### Zero days since the latest JavaScript framework

Developers don’t try your product the first time they hear about it.

Maybe after hearing positive things repeatedly, they’ll build enough trust to try your product on nights and weekends. There’s no shortage of new tools to try out. How can you stand out? They certainly don’t want to talk to someone to get access first.

**Building, growing, and retaining developer trust is everything.** Trust comes from your marketing being helpful regardless of the product. And retention comes from [making something developers actually want](/blog/make-something-developers-want).

Individual developers are tired of enterprise marketing being used on them. They’re the wrong audience – they don’t want the cold calls or unhelpful emails. And if you lose their trust, they’re quick to move on to other products.

Trust can be built (or quickly lost) through the content your create and put out into the community. It’s a reflection of what you stand for.

Here are some of my red flags when reading developer content:

- **Buzzwords and acronyms**: Sometimes these are necessary, but there’s a lot of copywriting that looks like “cutting-edge, LLM-powered RAG platform” when it should really be “bring knowledge to your AI model”. Acronyms also alienate newcomers.
- **Misusing technical terms**: Our JavaScript framework helps you make responsive websites” – does it though, or is that CSS? This can degrade trust because it shows the author might not have a deep understanding of the subject. Another example is broken or incorrectly formatted code examples. Did they even check that it works?
- **Overpromising simplicity**: The developer ecosystem is too obsessed with simplicity. I’m guilty myself. While “get started in one click” might be good sometimes, it can also be harmful. Maybe I want more options? Similarly, “simply install our SDK to get a 10x performance increase with no developer effort” might not be as simple as it sounds.
- **Vague explanations**: Developers want a practical example of what your product does. “Utilizing the latest technology to supercharge your development process”. Is this an editor, framework, database, or something else entirely?

Developers are more likely to trust open-source tools. These tools likely [have a community](https://janairis.medium.com/five-pillars-of-building-developer-communities-at-hashicorp-9c8f50198eb8) of other developers learning, sharing, and building products together. They can take their learned knowledge of the tool from job to job as they grow in their career.

### Show, don’t tell

Great developer marketing is both _concise_ and _precise_.

It values your time—every word matters. Show them how to build interesting things, don’t fill a post with 1000 words of garbage.

Consider an email announcing a new version of your product. The pricing has changed, and your data is going to be migrated.

- **How can I make it concise?**
  - **Put the bottom line up front**: If I stop reading after the first paragraph, did I get what I needed to know? Is there action required? Put that in the email subject line.
  - **Make it easy to scan**: The visual flow of the content is as important as the words you choose. They should be able to quickly scan for landmarks (like code examples or commands they need to run).
- **How can I make it precise?**
  - **Address their fears directly**: This email mentions a migration. Am I going to lose my data? Do I need to make changes right away? Am I going to be charged more?
  - **Personalize the content**: Show them their team name, the date the migration starts and finishes in UTC, exactly how much their price was before and after, and how they can take action (maybe a CLI command that shows their usage).

## Wait, what about DevRel?

[Developer Relations](/blog/devrel-at-vercel) should do developer marketing, but in my opinion, also more than that. It's the intersection between product, engineering, marketing, and sales.

You need the right leaders for both enterprise _and_ developer marketing.

- Enterprise marketing leaders have usually built their career in traditional marketing roles (content, product marketing, growth). They understand how to sell to developers, even if not one, and know how to build a pipeline generating engine.
- Developer marketing leaders usually come from non-marketing backgrounds (engineering, developer relations). They are an experienced developer who loves showing other developers how to build amazing things.

It’s possible for one person to do both well, but rare and they likely have decades of experience. It also depends on the size of the company.

## How can I improve my developer marketing?

1. Make sure your have the right leaders, teams, and strategy. If you’re a 10-person company, you can likely ignore the enterprise marketing.
2. Always consider how you can build developer trust. It’s not a one-time transaction. It’s reflected in every product and marketing decision you make.
3. Don’t publish content you wouldn’t share yourself. If it’s not meeting the mark, stop the line. Set the quality expectation.
